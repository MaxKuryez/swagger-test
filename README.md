Created 3 pages:
  1. / - info page
  2. /create-pet - create pet page
  3. /api-paths - paths page

  The first page rendres the info from swagger
  The second page allows to create a pet using https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/pet
  The third one is the page with paths, they can be expanded upon clicking on the drp downs

  Notes:
